Don't forget will need to set up functions for live data feeds
during prediction phase. Current functions are all bulk data for
training


Create classes for data preprocessing
All classes are part of a data_processing base class with the following Functions
get_training_data: returns large batches of historical data from X-Y
get_live_data: for actual predictions
preprocess_data: to process training or live data into standard format
